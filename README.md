## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS/SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- By looking at other people's solution, I learned expected behavior when clicking the button to filter, which is inclusive filter
- Use of useContext hook in react for global state management
- Use of css grid and media query for mobile screen
- SASS can nest the css properties

### Useful resources

- [grid tips for different screen sizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=705XCEruZFs) - This helped me for my project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Mastering css grid](https://appbrewery.github.io/css-display/) - This is an amazing free course by Colt Steele, my dear sensei.
